It's a big homework of Python at the end of the term. The goal is to make four(default) of ones pieces together.  

Man, that's virtually my first program on GitHub. So I would appreciate it a lot if any advice is given.

## Note
1. The way computer puts a piece is so stupid, I'm trying to work on it.
2. Currently, the hardest part is not to win or lose, but to not win and lose, which means tie game.
3. Trying to optimizing layout. Seems not a big deal

## How To Run
1. You can directly run the "main.py" file. Then it will run as usual (as the homework required) and automatically save a log file named after a 5 digit random number.
2. Or you can open python at the folder and run "from main import *". That will do.
